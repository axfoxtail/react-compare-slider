# Using `onlyHandleDraggable`

- [Live Examples](<#live-examples>)

The `onlyHandleDraggable` prop moves click, touch and drag from the main slider
container to the handle.

`onlyHandleDraggable` is useful for full width/height sliders on touch devices
where the user needs to touch the slider container to scroll past it
without the slider container capturing the event, changing its position.
`onlyHandleDraggable` is also useful when comparing interactive components which
have their own pointer events, such as embedded maps.
